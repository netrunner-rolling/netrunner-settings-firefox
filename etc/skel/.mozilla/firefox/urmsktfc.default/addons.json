Its purpose is to capture video and image files from many sites.\n\nJust surf the Web as you are used to, when DownloadHelper detects it can do something for you, the icon gets animated and a menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with MySpace, Google videos, DailyMotion, Porkolt, iFilm, DreamHost and others.\n\nSince version 3.1, you can setup the extension to automatically convert the downloaded movies to your preferred video format.\n\nWhen you are on a page containing links to images or movies, you can download some or all of them at once. Moving the mouse over the items in the menu will highlights the links directly in the page to make sure they are the ones you want to pick up.\n\nDownloadHelper also allows you to download files one by one, so that you keep bandwidth to surf for other stuff to download.\n\nTo modify your preferences, like changing the download directory, right-click on the icon and choose \"Preferences\".\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/manual.php and a faq at http://www.downloadhelper.net/faq.php\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nSupport can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php\n\n***********************\n\nSince May 2014, a spammer has been using Video DownloadHelper success to advertize for a trojan in the addons.mozilla.com reviews. Be careful !!!\n\nUPDATE: the guy above does not spam anymore but changed his strategy saying VDH is some kind of malware modifying browser search results. This is obviously wrong (addons at mozilla are being inspected by mozilla staff before being released publicly).","developerComments":"Please, do not use comments as support forum.\n\nIf you have problems installing or using DownloadHelper, you should have a look at the following resources:\n\n    the FAQ\n    the manual\n    the guide for video conversion\n\n\nIf you didn't find an answer from the links above, you can fill a support request from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support-expert.php\n\n**********************************************************\n\nTO THOSE WHO LIKE BLEEDING EDGE ADD-ON TECHNOLOGY:\n\nVideo DownloadHelper 4.9 includes a new beta feature: Direct Screen Capture\n\n    - the feature grabs the video directly from the screen. Even if this method has some inconvenience compared to the network capture (the video must be played on your screen the whole duration of the capture), it makes Video DownloadHelper work on all sites, regardless of the underlying streaming protocol. You can also capture videos from a flash applet running in the page which was previously not possible. \n\n\nTo enable that Screen Capture feature:\n\n    make sure you are running at least Firefox 4.0. It won't work on previous versions. If you haven't already done so, upgrade your browser from http://www.getfirefox.com/\n    open the Video DownloadHelper add-on preferences, section \"Capture\", tab \"Screen Capture\" and check the \"Enable Screen capture\" box\n    once the screen capture has been setup, you'll see a new button next to the DownloadHelper toolbar icon. Click it to start the capture of the currently playing video. Click again to stop the capture and save the file. Alternatively, you can use the context menu (right-click in the page but outside the flash area) to choose the screen region to be captured\n\n\nThe Screen Capture feature relies on external tools to do the grabbing, therefore it depends on the platform you are running on:\n\n    on Windows: you will have to also install the CSHelper add-on which provides a modified version of CamStudio. CSHelper and the software applications it contains are open sourced under the GPL license.\n    on Linux, the feature relies by default on the \"recordmydesktop\" application. If you are running Ubuntu, you may have to do \"sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop\" to install that program. On other Linux distributions, you'll figure out. You also may want to use another screen grabbing utility like xvidcap or something else: please let us know about your setup if you succeed\n    on Mac OS X, we haven't yet identified a suitable screen grabbing utility. If you are a Mac warrior and want to make some research on this, we'd love to hear from you","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7647.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7647.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"YouTube video download"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7649.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7649.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"DownloadHelper can help you !"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7650.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7650.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"DownloadHelper in Tools menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7651.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7651.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"DownloadHelper in Context menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7653.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7653.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"Highlighting items to download"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7654.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7654.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"Configuration and help menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7655.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7655.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"Configuration panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7677.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7677.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"Customize toolbars"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/7/7678.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/7/7678.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"Download menu"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/8/8335.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/8/8335.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","caption":"Download queue count"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/22/22864.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/22/22864.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/22/22865.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/22/22865.png?src=api&modified=1331247702","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150"}],"homepageURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/?src=api","supportURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/documentation.php","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":4775,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":185346062,"weeklyDownloads":471839,"dailyUsers":5079220,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/274932/video_downloadhelper-4.9.24-sm+fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":779652,"updateDate":1409908557000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"{aa26583b-4c35-4729-913e-156956078824}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6513-32.png?modified=1398366086","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6513-64.png?modified=1398366086"},"type":"theme","name":"Qute 3++","version":"1.28","creator":{"name":"gigaherz","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/gigaherz/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Murphy","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/Wolfgang_Carl/?src=api"}],"description":"Simple and unobtrusive theme with clear, colorful icons.
